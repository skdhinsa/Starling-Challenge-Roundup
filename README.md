# Creating a "round-up" feature

## API:
* **PUT**: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/feed/account/{accountUid}/savings-goals/round-up/transactions-between

Created a PUT endpoint for the 'round-up' feature for transactions in any given week.
* Path parameter:
  - accountUid

* Query parameters:
  - minTransactionTimestamp UTC
    - Example : 2020-06-01T12:34:56.000Z
  - maxTransactionTimestamp UTC
    - Example : 2020-07-01T12:34:56.000Z

Can use an API testing tool, Postman for instance, to make a request to the roundup endpoint.
Can then use relevant savings-goal endpoints to see updates made.
